          <p>
            Exhibition and promotional design for Speculative History→Design, an exhibition featuring the work of six fashion design students on view at VCUarts Qatar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The visual identity was developed with a focus on highlighting the diverse garments while having an overarching show identity. Given the themes of the show, the arrow motif was developed to enhance it's message while acting as a visual connection throughout. Each wall vinyl design corresponds with the respective artist, utilizing their provided garment flats enlarged to an abstract level.

          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired both by the idea of stars and a physical space, this poster seeks to incoporate both elements with a pixel star bouncing off the poster edges and text. Design modified slightly in order to create a digital banner to accompany the more traditional poster.
